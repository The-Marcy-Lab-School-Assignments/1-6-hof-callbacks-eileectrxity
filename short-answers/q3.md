# Question

What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer

In the following code block, the third line is breaking the code, returning a TypeError where at nums.forEach(<anonymous>) denoting that "undefined is not a function".

What this means is that while we want the .forEach() method (expecting a function reference) to pass on the callback function of printDouble to each element in a given nums array, it is actually invoking the printDouble function in place instead of passing it on. Since the invocation of printDouble did not include an argument passed in for the num parameter needed, the value of that invocation returns undefined. To fix this, we can just remove the two parenthesis after printDouble to not invoke the function but pass it on through the .forEach() method.
